Extra credit features:
1. Task 1: Wu's antialiasing line rendering algorithm
2. Task 3: MLAA. The implementation is based on "Practical Morphological Anti-
Aliasing" (Jimenez, Jorge, et al.). Although initially I intended to implement
it on GPU, it turned out that the structure of given code does not really
support programmable pipeline and shaders. Therefore, I end up implementing a
CPU version to simulate the original one. See src/mlaa.cpp and src/mlaa.hpp for
details. When running the application, use keyboard "," key to toggle MLAA.

Other comments:
1. In task 2, the computation of my implementation is only related to the area
of triangle. I first calculate the leftmost and rightmost bound of the triangle,
then for each row I perform sweep-line traversal. (Unfortunately there are some
new and delete in the function which is not the most efficient way, but the
amount of heap allocated storage is fairly small).

[COMPILE NOTIFICATION!!!!!!!!]
2. There are several new source files besides the given ones. I have modified
CMake files in order to compile them.
